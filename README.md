[Portfolio website](https://lanruoj.github.io/)  
[Github repository](https://github.com/Lanruoj/Lanruoj.github.io)  
[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/BUdvHsC6/t1a2-portfolio-kanban-tan%C3%A9-kaio)

## Purpose
The purpose of this website is for me to showcase my evolving skills as a web developer, not only in the hopes of impressing a recruiter from the tech industry, but to practise and develop experience with what I'm learning. It is a way of challenging myself to learn more, push the boundaries of my abilities and have a visual representation of the hard work I've been putting into my studies.

## Functionality and features
Some features of my site include:
* A fixed and floating header module
* A navigation menu that can be toggled whether it's visible or not
* Container styling in the form of "cards"
* Flexible and responsive layouts using CSS Flexbox
* Optimisation for a wide range of screen widths and devies
* Legible typography and high contrast between background and text
* Visually appealing use of colours
* A layout that's easy to follow
* Embedded resume PDF with a download link
* Images 
* Expandable containers with the use of a checkbox button
* Smooth transitions on effects whenever possible

## Here is a rough sitemap of the navigation flow:

## Target audience
The target audience for my portfolio website is recruiters/employers from the tech industry, as well as other developers or designers for collaboration purposes. 

## Tech stack
I decided to restrict myself to pure HTML and CSS for this project, which was definitely challenging considering what I wanted to achieve, however I believe I did pretty well without resorting to JavaScript etc.  
List of tools:  
* HTML for document content and structure
* CSS (as compiled by SCSS)
* SCSS for styling/functionality
* Visual Studio Code as my IDE
* Live Server extension for VSCode
* Git for version control
* Github to store my repository and workflow
* Github Pages for deployment
* Balsamiq for wireframes/sitemap
* Trello for kanban board/to-do-list
* Google Slides for slide deck presentation
* Canva for graphics
* Google Chrome and its developer tools
* W3C Validation tools
* Bear notes app
* Mac terminal CLI
